# Context
- Prompt requested cleanup of `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` so completed features are not kept in long implementation-detail blocks and are instead listed simply.

# Decision
- Reworked `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` to:
  - collapse completed work into simple list entries,
  - remove detailed completed-feature plan sections for already finished features,
  - keep detailed planning only for the deferred feature (`Full visual redesign`).

# Consequences
- The roadmap document is shorter and easier to scan.
- Completed items are now status-oriented (list form) rather than plan-oriented.
- Deferred work remains detailed and ticket-ready.
