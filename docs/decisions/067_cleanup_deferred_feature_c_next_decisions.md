# Context
- Prompt requested: "Clean up deferred feature c from next decisions".
- `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` still contained a long `Deferred Feature C - Full visual redesign` implementation block despite Feature C being completed.

# Decision
- Removed the stale `Deferred Feature C - Full visual redesign` implementation section and its related planning sub-sections from `NEXT_DECISIONS.md`.
- Kept the concise completion record in `Completed Features` and normalized `Completed Directions` wording to `Direction 6 - Full visual redesign`.

# Consequences
- `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` now reflects current roadmap state without obsolete deferred/planning content for Feature C.
- Future planning sections remain focused on active post-Feature-C refinements.
