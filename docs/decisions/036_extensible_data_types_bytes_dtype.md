# Context
- Prompt requested implementation of **Extensible data types** as the next in-progress roadmap item.
- Canon constraints require deterministic generation, standard-library-only implementation, GUI accessibility where applicable, and actionable validation errors.

# Decision
- Implemented `bytes` as a first-class dtype across core paths:
  - schema validation (`SUPPORTED_DTYPES`, bytes-specific constraints and fix-hint errors),
  - runtime generation fallback (deterministic binary payload generation),
  - GUI column authoring dtype list,
  - SQL DDL and SQLite type mapping (`BLOB`),
  - CSV export conversion of bytes payloads to base64 text.
- Added focused unit tests for bytes generation determinism, SQL/SQLite compatibility, CSV export encoding, and validation guardrails.
- Updated canonical docs and roadmap status to reflect extensible dtype completion.

# Consequences
- Extensible dtype roadmap item is now concretely implemented via `bytes`.
- Generated bytes data remains deterministic and exportable without breaking CSV portability.
- Validation now prevents incompatible bytes config patterns with actionable fix hints.
