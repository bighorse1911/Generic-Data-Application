# Context
- Prompt requested implementation of the prioritized GUI refinement backlog and explicit insertion into `NEXT_DECISIONS.md`.
- Feature C is already marked complete; this change defines the next refinement wave.

# Decision
- Updated `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` to replace the empty next-candidates placeholder with prioritized P1-P8 GUI refinement items.
- Added a dedicated `GUI Refinement Backlog (Prioritized)` section containing summary, prioritized steps, planned API/type additions, test scenarios, and assumptions/defaults.

# Consequences
- Roadmap now has actionable, ordered post-Feature-C GUI work ready for ticket breakdown.
- Future implementation scope and acceptance expectations are explicitly documented in one place.
