# Context
- Follow-up feedback indicated `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` did not appear updated.
- Priority 1 completion text existed, but it was placed under `In Progress`, which could be interpreted as unfinished.

# Decision
- Moved Priority 1 completion wording into the completed section to make status explicit.
- Removed the duplicate completion line from `In Progress`.

# Consequences
- `NEXT_DECISIONS.md` now clearly communicates that Priority 1 is complete.
- Roadmap readability improved without changing runtime behavior or tests.
